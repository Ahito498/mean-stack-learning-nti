# Tasks Directory

This directory contains all individual task folders for the NTI course.

## Task Organization

Each task should be organized in its own folder with the following structure:

│   └── notes.md
├── task-02/

1. **README.md** - Task description, requirements, and instructions
2. **solution/** - Your solution files

4. **notes.md** - Your personal notes and thoughts
